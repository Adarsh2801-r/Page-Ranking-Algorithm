# Page-Ranking-Algorithm
The PageRank algorithm is implemented with and without random teleportations using the
following two methods â€“
A. Finding the principal left eigenvector of the probability transition matrix directly i.e., by making use
of numerical linear algebra packages
B. Finding the principal left eigenvector of the probability transition matrix Power Iteration method.
Random Teleportations Hyper parameter: Teleportation to
a random page with probability of 0.1
