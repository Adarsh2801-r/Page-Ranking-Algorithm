# Page-Ranking of Web graph
The PageRank algorithm is implemented with and without random teleportations using the
following two methods â€“ </br>
A. Finding the principal left eigenvector of the probability transition matrix directly i.e., by making use
of numerical linear algebra packages </br>
B. Finding the principal left eigenvector of the probability transition matrix Power Iteration method. </br>
Random Teleportations Hyper parameter: Teleportation to
a random page with probability of 0.1
