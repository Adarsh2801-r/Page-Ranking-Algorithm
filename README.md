# Page-Ranking-Algorithm
The PageRank algorithm should be implemented with and without random teleportations using the
following two methods –
A. Finding the principal left eigenvector of the probability transition matrix directly i.e., by making use
of numerical linear algebra packages
B. Finding the principal left eigenvector of the probability transition matrix Power Iteration method.
You should implement Random Teleportations with the following hyper parameter: Teleportation to
a random page with probability of 0.1
